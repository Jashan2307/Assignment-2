            <p><strong>Bhagat Singh was an Indian anti-colonial revolutionary born in 1907 in Banga, Punjab, British India. He was a critic of British rule and was involved in two significant attacks on British authorities. In 1928, Singh and his associate, Shivaram Rajguru, mistakenly shot a junior British police officer in Lahore, Punjab. They also participated in a symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail. Singh's actions made him a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23, he became a martyr and folk hero in Northern India. His actions and ideas influenced the growing militancy in India in the 1930s.</strong></p>
